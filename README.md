# WordPress to Kirby Exporter

Export WordPress posts and attachments into folders and text files.

Based on Florian Zieglerâ€™s [WordPress to Kirby Exporter](https://github.com/florianziegler/haptiq-kirby-exporter)


## What it does

- Running the exporter will create a folder called `kirby-export` inside your WordPress website's root folder.
- It will create a folder for each post using the following pattern: `YYYYMMDD_{post-slug}`.
- It will copy all images/files which are attached to a post into the post's folder and for each file add a meta data file, eg. `{filename.jpg}.txt`, containing alt and caption.
- Finally it will add a file with the pattern `YYYYMMDD_{post-slug}.txt` containing the post title, publication date, content and tags.

**Please note:**  
- WordPress short codes will be removed.


## Installation

- Copy the `wordpress-kirby-export.php` file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress install.
